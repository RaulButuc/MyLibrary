# MyLibrary
A personal and custom library that will eventually contain all the common data structures. The implementation uses templates and custom iterators to allow the usage of the common STL algorithms on the containers (where possible). The project also contains a custom (minimal) unit test framework.

### Data structures included so far

- Singly Linked List (Forward List)
- Doubly Linked List (List)

### Coming soon

- Stack
- Queue
- Double Ended Queue (Deque)
- Set
- Map
- And many others to follow
